What OSCpad will be:

- An nds homebrew application that is basically a very flexible controller sending OSC (Open Sound Control) messages for almost every input available.
- A reference implementation for sending OSC data over the DSWifi connection
- (eventually) my first successfully completed NDS app (har har)
