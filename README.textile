What OSCpad will be:

 * An nds homebrew application that is basically a very flexible controller sending OSC (Open Sound Control) messages for almost every input available.
 * A reference implementation for sending OSC data over the DSWifi connection
 * (eventually) my first successfully completed NDS app (har har)

What OSCpad is right now:

* A proof of concept of using dswifi to send UDP packages
* A way to send non-OSC upd packets on the press of the A-Button

What OSCpad will become quite soon:

* a proof of concept on how to construct OSC messages

What OSCpad will need for that:

* A simple way to construct strings with 32Byte padding
* A simple way to convert the endianness of 32Byte values (try ntohl, I'd say)

What OSCpad learned me (is this even a sentence?)

* OSCpack is not suited for embedded usage, at least not for someone with limited C/C++ knowledge, such as me.
